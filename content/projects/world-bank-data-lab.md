From December 2020 to March 2021, I developed a static website for the World Bank's Data Lab Department, where I was asked to build a simple static site that would receive new content through Forestry.io. With the help of HUGO as a static site generator tool, I was able to create a static site with dynamic content and without the need for a complicated database setup. Some of the skills I was able to improve bny developing this site are: better file structure for static content and Javascript, Object Oriented Programming concepts that allowed me to create different Javascript plugins by iterating from an imperative style into encapsulated DRY code and using Immediately Invoked Function Expressions to run scripts when they are needed by the site.


** Possible Improvements**

Although performance, accessibility, mobile responsiveness and other best practices where taken into considerations, there are some improvements that could be done to the site, which where not developed further, because the client did not require them for their team.
There are some accessibility changes that can be made in terms of contrasting colors so that they meet with WCGA compliance. Some performance optimizations that can be made are mostly related to images and loading on mobile devices, where the use of ```srcset``` attribute on images and adding pre-optimized images with sizes for multiple devices, could improve performance for mobile and web devices greatly.
