Hello, my name is Edgar Negr√≥n. I used to work in the TV industry, but now I'm a Web Developer. In 2019, I decided to study web development and I've been working as a Developer since October of the same year.

I can work any stack. I love them all. Some of the languages and frameworks I've worked with are:

1. HTML & CSS (SCSS)
2. Javascript (React, Vue.js, Node/Express)
3. Python (Flask)
4. Ruby (Ruby on Rails)
5. SQL (Sqlite, MySql, MongoDB)
6. Static Site Generators (Jekyll, Hugo)
7. Content Management Systems (Wordpress and Drupal)
8. Docker
9. Version Control (Github and GitLab) 
10. CI/CD workflows
11. Deployment (Netlify and Heroku)

My portfolio is an opportunity to display some of the projects that I've worked on through the last couple of years.
